# taxCalculator

**Author: Christina Trialoni**


This project was made to practise with refactoring methods and rules in Java.

In this app, the user opens the window and by pressing the correct button he can choose to read txt or xml files that contain information on tax payers.

Once opened, the main window fills with the information and the user can either close the tab, add a new tax payer, add or delete receipts, create charts or create log files in txt or xml format.

*Solo Uni project - A tax calculator app based on Java, made on eclipse.*

*For the charts, the library jfreechart is required/used (http://www.jfree.org/index.html).*
