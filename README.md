Solo Uni project - A tax calculator app based on Java, made on eclipse

Author: Christina Trialoni

This project was made to practise with refactoring methods and rules in Java. In this app, the user opens a window and can read txt files that contain information of tax payers in special format. Once opened, the main window fills with the information and the user can either close the tab, add a new Tax payer, add or delete information (Receipts), create charts or create log files in txt or xml format.

For the charts, the library jfreechart is required/used (http://www.jfree.org/index.html).
